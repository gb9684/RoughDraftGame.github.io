## Space Rocks (tutorial asset pack, GameMakerStudio)

This is my **rough draft** game i recently made/first attempt at gamemakerstudio!
File will eventually be updated via the Github repository, last updated posted *12/28/2023*.

DISCLAIMER: The purpose for this game is purely self educational, I do not own any of the assets used. I am practicing GameMakerStudio for an upcoming Game Jam. This file is being posted with intent to share with family/friends. There are still issues that persist within the game, it is a work in progress. please be mindful of this if you decide to play/comment on the repository.
